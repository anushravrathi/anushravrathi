### Hi there 👋
I'm Anushrav Rathi, a student at VIT Bhopal University by day, and a tech nerd by night. 🌙

💻 My Coding Symphony:

Python 🐍: Where I dance with elegance and simplicity.
HTML/CSS 🎨: Adding a splash of style to the web canvas.
C/C++ 💪: Building the sturdy foundations of my programming fortress.
JavaScript ✨: Sprinkling magic to make things interactive.
🧠 Specializing in AI/ML.

Python is my wand for casting spells in the realm of AI and ML.
From predicting the future to making machines see and understand, I'm on a mission!
📚 Currently flipping through the pages of the AI adventure novel. Expecting dragons, unicorns, and maybe a sentient toaster. 🤖

🚀 Join me on this quest to turn coffee into code, and dreams into software. If you're into Python, AI, or just good vibes, let's connect and craft some digital magic together!

May your code compile and your bugs be elusive! 🦄✨
